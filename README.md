# Automated Fluid Dispenser Prototype

#Overview

The Automated Fluid Dispenser is a precision-engineered device designed to dispense user-specified fluid volumes within 1 mL of accuracy. This innovative system, capable of handling powder and water mixtures, ensures precise dispensing within a tight time frame of 120 seconds into five test tubes. The mechanism employs a turntable connected to a 1:200 gearbox and DC motor, applying specific torque to rotate the turntable rack, effectively filling the tubes. Infared sensors are used to accurately detect when the tube is in place to dispense fluid. Safety features include an emergency stop button and protective enclosures for individual components. Utilizing a peristaltic pump for fluid dispensing and a servo motor for powder flow control, this device successfully passed all tests, marking the first step for practical applications in medical and pharmaceutical industries.
